# Tech Stack

# Features

## Backend
1. Code the editor into the tutorial section. Should be an easy install ideally. 

## UI/UX

1. Make both the navigation section and the tutorial sections seperate scrolls. Stacking with moving inside parts. (essentially)
2. When you select the underlined items, it should jump to those sections. (think the problem is caused from the tag portion. Double hashtag most likely) Also should highlight the section as I go through it and it can be clicked to jump to each of the sections. 

## testing commits
have done some research on making my own local models.
